<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
The Salla Command Line Interface (Salla CLI) is your way to create your starter Salla Apps which works with the [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). Your App later can be published to the [Salla App Store](https://apps.salla.sa/) and be available for installation to any of Salla [Merchants Stores](https://s.salla.sa/).

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The Salla CLI (salla-cli) is packaged to be used globally. It is available via npm and is installed globally by running `npm install -g salla-cli`.

Salla CLI comes with an easy to use, straight-forward commands that does the complete setup to either your Salla Theme or App. To be ready, you will need some prerequisites which will be listed hereafter.

What can you use Salla CLI for?
* Create your own Salla Theme
* Single-taps to create your own Salla App
* Login to your Salla Store

<!-- The starter App comes with an easy _1-command step_ that does the complete setup for your starter App. To be ready, you will need some prerequisites which will be listed hereafter. -->

### Salla CLI Commands

The following commands using the prefix `salla` in order to excute the commands:
- create app
- create theme

#### `create app`

You can create a Salla Partners App by running the following command:

```bash
salla create app <appName>
```

<!-- ![](InteractiveTerminalActivityPicture) -->

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>appName <appName></td>
      <td>The app name will be used to create a folder in your project root as well as in the Salla Dashboard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  > Note: The `appName` should only consist of letters and numbers. If you specify a `.`, `./` or a `<space>` in the name, `salla create app` will throw an error.

##### Examples

Create a Salla App named `my-awesome-app` using the `salla create app` command:

```bash
salla create app my-awesome-app
```

### Prerequisites
-   Create a Partner account at  [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)
-   Create your App in [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.dev/blog/create-your-first-app-on-salla-developer-portal/)

    > From your App dashboard at [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/), you will be able to get your App's _Client ID, Client Secret Key and Webhook Secret Key_ which you will use later duraing the setup process.

-   For Laravel compatibility: `PHP >= 7.4, Composer package manager and MySql Database`
-   Install [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok): `npm install ngrok -g`
-   Other requirments: `Nodejs and npm`

That is all!

<!-- ### Installation -->
The installation process is straightforward as you will see in the below steps.

1. In your MySql Database: **create a database** with any name for example  `laravel`.

2.  In your command line: **run** the following `create-project` composer command to create your Laravel starter App project.
```sh
composer create-project salla/laravel-starter-kit {your-awesome-app}
```

The above `create-project` will take you through a step-by-step process in which you'll enter your App's _Client ID, Client Secret Key, and Webhook Secret Key_, which you can get from your App dashboard in the Partners Panel, as well as your database name, which is set to `laravel` by default.

> The step will ask you to select the authorization mode for your App, which can be [Easy or Custom mode.](#auth-modes)
> In case you selected the _Custom_ mode for your App authorization, you will need to enter the **same callback Url you already entered in your App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)**

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ## Usage -->

1. In your command line: **Run** `php artisan serve.remote` command

![XBHrsHj4-2021-11-19 at 00 37 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10876587/142501121-48608b18-a14e-4f6d-968c-022b6a29b221.gif)

Now you can open your browser to view your App at `Remote App Url` in the [output URLs.](#output-urls).  ðŸŽ‰

2. Login to the Laravel App with the demo account:  Email:  `awesome@salla.dev`, Password:  `in ksa`
3. Click the button to request the _Access Token_.
4. The Laravel App will redirect you to Merchant Auth Page.
5. Login using a Merchant Account (or the demo store of your app).
5. Give access to your App.


> If you are using [Easy mode.](#auth-modes.easy) the access token will push to the action ([`StoreAuthorize`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php#L18)) via webhook
>
> If you are using [Custom mode.](#auth-modes.custom) the browser will redirect you again to the [`callback() page`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php#L26).

#### Output URLs <span id='output-urls'>

| URL               | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local App Url      | The local link for your App\.                                                                                     |
| Remote App Url     | The online link to your App\. It will be always synced with the local Url                                         |
| Webhook Url        | The Url link that connects your App with any action that may happen at the Merchant store, e\.g\. \ncreate new product\. |
| OAuth Callback Url | The App entry page where the access token is generated; Note that this Url is available only for the `Custom` mode auth.                                                               |


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- ## Configure Authorization Modes <span id='auth-modes'> -->

While creating your App in the [Salla Partners Portal](https://salla.partners/), you will see that Salla provids two methods for the OAuth protocol, which are the `Easy Mode` and the `Custom Mode`.
    
> During the setup process, the default _OAuth protocol_ will be set to the `Easy Mode`, which can be configured from the file [`.env`](.env).
> All of the setup's values/keys are stored in the `.env` file as we can see in the below image.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TvSCAWC.png" width="660" alt="Salla Laravel App folder structure"></p>

#### Easy Mode <span id='auth-modes.easy'>
    
This mode is the default mode for the authorization, which means that the `access token` is generated automatically at Salla's side back to you.
You may refer to the class [`StoreAuthorize`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php#L18) which is defined inside [`app\Actions\App\StoreAuthorize.php`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php) to get more details on how to receive and manage the `access token`

    
#### Custom Mode <span id='auth-modes.custom'>
    
A callback Url is the Url that is triggered when the App has been granted authorization. This should be a valid Url to which the merchant's browser is redirected. In this mode, you will need to set a custom callback url from the App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/). This callback url will redirect the merchants who are interested in using your app into your App entry page where the access token is generated.

You may refere to file [`app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php) which contains the [`callback()`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php#L26) function. This function is responsible for generating the `access token`

> The custom url will redirect the merchant to the [Store Dashboard](https://s.salla.sa/apps) in order to access the Store where he needs your App to be installed.

<br />
    
<!-- ## Authorization Service -->
    
This project comes with a simple singleton authorization service to help you with managing the access and refresh tokens
    
```php
// set the current user or any user you want to use his access tokens
app('salla.auth')->forUser(auth()->user());

// Get the get the store details
/** Salla\OAuth2\Client\Provider\SallaUser::class **/
app('salla.auth')->getResourceOwner();

// Made an API request using the current access token of the user
app('salla.auth')->request('GET', 'https://api.salla.dev/admin/v2/products')['data'];
    
// Request a new access token
app('salla.auth')->getNewAccessToken();

// Save the access token
auth()->user()->token()->create([
    'merchant'      => 'id',
    'access_token'  => 'access token',
    'expires_in'    => 'expires in sec',
    'refresh_token' => 'refresh token'
]);
```

<!-- ### Refreshing a Token -->

Access tokens expire after one week. Once expired, you will have to refresh a userâ€™s access token. you can easily request a new access token via the current refresh token for any user like this

```php
try {
    // set the current user
    // or any user you want to refresh his access token
    app('salla.auth')
        ->forUser(auth()->user())
        ->getNewAccessToken();
    
    // by defaul the function `getNewAccessToken` will get a new access token 
    // and save the new access token to the same user you are set it in the `forUser` function
} catch (\League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException $exception) {
    // in case the token access token & refresh token is expired
    // you should redirect the user again to Salla authorization service to get a new token
    // return redirect()->route('oauth.redirect');
}
```
<br />
    
<!-- Webhooks -->
<!-- ## Webhooks -->
[Webhooks](https://docs.salla.dev/docs/merchant/ZG9jOjI0NTE3NDg1-webhook) simplify the communication between your App and [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). In this way, you will be notified whenever your app receives payload/data from the Salla APIs. These webhooks are triggered along with many actions such as an order or product being created, a customer logs in, a coupon is applied, and much more.

Salla already defined a list of the webhooks/actions that are triggered automatically. The predefined webhooks/actions can be found in the folder [`app/Actions`](https://github.com/SallaApp/Laravel-Start-Kit/tree/master/app/Actions).

The predefined [Webhooks](#webhooks), events/actions, can be found in folder [`app/Actions`](https://github.com/SallaApp/Salla-CLI/tree/master/app/Actions).
> You may define your own new webhook/action the way fits your App's requirments.
```sh
php artisan make:webhook.event {event-name}
```
